### Handle css files

- Where are they after webpack did its stuff ?

### What to put in publish ? We should remove a lot of stuff (see react paginate lib)

### Make it work

### DOc to precise

- Add css file import for crop lib in \_app.tsx

- Add css file for file input file

- Add css for pagination (import "../module/style/pagination.css";)

- nextjs : Add document pour react-jss (https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/deprecated-main/examples/with-react-jss/pages/_document.js)

TO do later

- We can zoom and rotate the image in uploader
- We can add custom component in gallery to handle systems like tags

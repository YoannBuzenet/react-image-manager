- check tsconfig & wbpack to find this window problem ?
- understand why sourcemap seems to be not used when deployed in lib
- Finish Setup Test app (`demo` folder) to easily test RIM in a local env
- Setup a next app v12 to see how it behaves in a local env
- Setup a next app v13 to see how it behaves in a local env
- Refacto, code is awful rn omg
- Typescript ftw : add types everywhere and pass everything in .tsx
- Allow more customization by user
